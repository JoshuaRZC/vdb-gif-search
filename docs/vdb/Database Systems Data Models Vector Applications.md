# [[Database Systems Data Models Vector]] Applications

- [[Database Systems Data Models]]
- [[Database Systems Data Models Vector]]

We are in the midst of the AI revolution. It is upending any industry it touches, promising great innovations, but it also introduces new challenges. Efficient data processing has become more crucial than ever for applications that involves large language model (LLM), generative AI, and semantic search.

All these new applications rely on Vector Embedding ([[Database Systems Data Models Vector Embeddings]]), a type of vector data representing that carries within its semantic information that is critical for AI to gain understanding and maintain a long-term memory that they can draw upon when executing complex tasks. Then, Vector Databases have many use cases across different domains and applications that involve Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Recommendation Systems (RS), and other areas that require semantic understanding and matching of data.

## Overview

- Database Systems Data Models Vector Application Similarity Search (RS):
    - Similar Images: Find images that are similar to a given image based on their visual content and style
    - Similar Documents: Find documents that are similar to a given document based on their topic and sentiment
    - Similar Products (Products Recommendation): Find products that are similar to a given product based on their features and ratings
- Database Systems Data Models Vector Application Natural Language processing:
    - Large Language Models (LLM): Vector database can be used by LLM to store information to generate more relevant and coherent text based on an AI plugin.
        - Large Language Model Challenges: Generating inaccurate or irrelevant information; Lacking factual consistency or common sense; Repeating or contradicting themselves; Being biased or offensive.
        - Vector Database Solution: To overcome these challenges, we can use a vector database to store information about different topics, keywords, facts, opinions, and/or sources related to our desired domain or genre.
            - Then, we can use a large language model and pass information from the vector database with your AI plugin to generate more informative and engaging content that matches your intent and style.
        - Vector Database LLM Use Case: For example, if we want to write a blog post about the latest trends in AI, we can use a vector database to store the latest information about that topic and pass the information along with the ask to a LLM in order to generate a blog post that leverages the latest information.
