# [[Database Systems Data Models Vector]] Embeddings

- [[Database Systems Data Models]]
- [[Database Systems Data Models Vector]]

Vector Embeddings are generated by AI Models (Large Language Model) and have many attributes or features, making their representation challenging to manage. In the context of [[Machine Learning]], these features represent different dimensions of the data that are essential for understanding patterns, relationships, and underlying structures.

Such complex vector embeddings expect a specialized database designed specially for handling this data type. Vector databases fulfill this requirement by offering optimized storage and querying capabilities for embeddings. The challenge of working with vector data is that traditional scalar-based database cannot keep up with the complexity and scale of Vector Embeddings, making it difficult to extract insights and perform real-time analysis.
